<p>He remembers it this way: He was two and a half years old, and he had come with his dad and mom to the doctor's office. The town they lived in had only one doctor: Dr.Skaggs, and he was already an ancient man who would have retired long ago if he had been able to find a suitable replacement. As it was, the boy was there with his parents to welcome a new brother or sister into the family. </p><p> These were the days before doctors could tell you the sex of a baby before it was born, but the boy knew he would soon have a baby brother. After all, that is what his Ma Nellie had told everyone. Ma Nellie said it had to do with the way the boy's mom carried the baby inside her belly. And as far as the boy was concerned, what Ma Nellie said was the gospel truth. </p><p> He remembers drinking a Coke. It was one of those six and a half ounce glass bottles of the nectar that had the highest ratio of fizz to drink available. It was so potent that a swig of it could bring tears to your eyes if you swallowed it too quickly. Maybe his tears were the reason he made a wrong turn when he left the bathroom to return to the waiting room were his dad was sitting.

Instead the boy found himself in a hallway. He could hear voices coming from a room at the end of the corridor, as well as a baby crying. Curious, he made his way to the room and opened the door. </p><p>The first thing he saw was his mother laying on a bed, with her legs sprawled open. The next thing he saw was the blood. To his eyes the blood seemed to be everywhere. And though it was the first time had seen so much blood, he wasn't scared. He didn't know about the danger of too much blood loss then, and to him it was pretty - especially the blood soaked into the sheets of bed.

He stared into the room and watched as the Doctor and two nurses hovered around his mom. Then a small blur of motion in the corner of his eye caught his attention. Turning, he saw his baby brother in the incubator. Tiny hands and feet waving in the air. He smiled and said, "Hello baby brother. How are you?"

His smile faded quickly however when he heard the doctor's voice, "What the hell is that kid doing in here? Get him the hell out of here, now!"

One of the nurses came over to him, and turning him around, led him back to the waiting room to his dad. </p><p>"Where've you been, boy?" his father asked.

"I saw my brother," he said.

"Well, you better get over here sit your hind end down and stay put." his father replied. "Cause if I have to sit you down myself, you're gonna be hurtin' before you're sitting."

"Okay," he said, taking another tear-inducing swig of his Coke.
