The Church is dead.  There, I said it, and I mean it.  Of course, I say this from my own very limited perspective of having served only six churches, all but one of which is dying.  Wracked by conflict, having an eternally internal mindset, and incapable of making disciples of/for Jesus, five of the churches I have served have been declining for decades now.  Nothing short of a miracle can save them, and miracles, it seems, are in short supply.

The problems these churches face are myriad and great.  In addition to the ones I listed above, the churches I have pastored have an edifice complex.  They are focused upon maintaining their buildings, even when the structures they seek to preserve were built for hundreds of more people than they currently count as members, and even when the cost of maintenance alone takes far more money than most of them spend of ministry and mission in any number of years.

These churches are, without exception, pastor-centered.  The single greatest cost for each of them is the pastoral support of a full-time, and in some cases part-time, ordained minister.  Almost 50% of the budget in my current church is spent providing for my salary, health insurance, professional expenses, and pension.  And though I make enough for my needs at this time, ten years of higher education and three degrees would earn me much more in other fields.

Most of these congregations also wouldn't know what to do with a visitor or how to treat a guest if their lives depended upon it, which they do.  Most congregations have a built in bias for people who are just like them.  So those who are different, who come from different socio-economic classes or different races, are often ignored.  Further, if visitors are families, they are often welcomed with open arms, but single visitors, especially men, are often viewed suspiciously and not greeted at all.

But by far the greatest problem of all, and the single most important factor that is killing most churches today, including the ones I have served is this: They have forgotten that their number one priority, their most important job, is to proclaim and live the gospel of Jesus Christ.  And while the word gospel means "good news," the truth is that the words of Jesus are rarely viewed as good by the vast majority of church-goers.

And why should they?  Contrary to many prosperity preachers proclamations, Jesus never told anybody that they would have all their material needs met once they started to follow him.  He never said to his disciples, "I'm gonna make your rich."  He never once promised them an easy road or path to success.  No, instead Jesus said:

* "Blessed are the poor."
* "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for the rich to enter the kingdom of heaven."
* "You cannot serve God and money."
* "Woe to you who are rich, for you have received your consolation."

And as if that were not enough, he would also add:

* "If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me."
* "Whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me."
* And "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me."

That last quote is especially appropriate for the Church, which, though it is dying, clings to its possessions with a death grip, and which hopes against hope that it can somehow save itself.  The quote is from the story of a very wealthy man who seeks out Jesus.  Here is Mark's version of the tale:

> And as Jesus was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.'" And he said to him, "Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth." And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, "You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me." Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. (Mark 10:17-22)

Like the man in the story above, churches can do a lot of good things.  Many contribute money and time to missions (though often very little in the overall scheme of things).  Almost every church has at least one good ministry. And most Christians care deeply for each other and will go out of their way to help one of their own.  But these things are not enough, especially when churches, like the ones I am familiar with, fail to actually be the Church and do what the Church is called to do.

And so, rather than actually be the Church, churches are all about survival . . . keeping the doors open as long as is humanely possible, so that the needs of those already a part of the church can be met up until the day they die and are buried.  And because of this, not just members, but entire churches, are dying . . . and they should.

They should die because they refuse to follow Jesus.  Most churches would be better off if they divested themselves of all their valuables and gave everything they own to the poor.  Maybe then they could hear the good news that money doesn't matter, that possessions own you rather than the other way around, and that Jesus wants everything we have, not just what we deign to give him.   And how is this good news?  Its good news because Jesus wants us.  He wants us, and he loves us; not the things we have.  I have always loved Mark's version of the story above because it is only in Mark that we find the words "And Jesus, looking at him, loved him."  And this is also how he sees and feels about the Church, even as the Church walks away from its Lord sorrowful, since it has many possessions.

Okay, so maybe the Church isn't dead . . . yet.  But the Church as we know it is dying.  It is in its death throes, and that, my friends, is a good thing. I say let the Church die, give it a good funeral service, and then let's see what new life will spring forth from its corpse.  As Jesus once said, "Truly I say tell, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
