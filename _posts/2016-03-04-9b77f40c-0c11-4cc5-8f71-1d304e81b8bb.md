I hear them breathing  
and in the dim light of the luminescent clock,  
I see the gentle rise of the covers and  
their subtle movements

walking to their room,  
moments before,  
the cold of the hard floor on my feet  
had seeped into my heart,  
but it was not cold enough to numb  
the panic I felt.

but now,  
kneeling in my underwear by their bed.  
at 4:00 a.m.  
things are better than I thought  
mom and dad are here, asleep,  
and I know I am not alone.  
the terror invoked by my dreams recedes.

touching their sleeping feet -  
just to make sure,  
I turn and tiptoe back to bed,  
I will sleep again,  
the dreams will return,  
but for now,  
for just this moment,  
I am not afraid.
